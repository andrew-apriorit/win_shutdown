1. Service installation
You can use bat files to install and uninstall the service. 
- The service_install.bat should be located in the same folder with exe file (or just edit the binPath parameter to the correct path to exe file)
- The service_uninstall.bat can be located anywhere.
- Please, don't forget to start bat files as administrator.

2. Log file
Please, pay attention that the log file is located in C:\Windows\System32 for x86 systems and in C:\Windows\SysWOW64 for x64 systems. 
You can use the test-Shortcut or the test-Shortcut-x64 shortcuts to access your log files fast.
